# Lifecare Hospital ER Simulation

A comprehensive **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** model for analyzing Emergency Room performance and optimizing staffing decisions. This project implements a queue-based simulation system that models patient flow through triage and consultation stages.

## üìã Project Overview

This simulation helps hospital administrators understand:
- **Patient flow** through the ER system
- **Bottleneck identification** in triage vs. consultation
- **Resource utilization** of nurses and doctors
- **Wait time optimization** strategies
- **Staffing recommendations** based on data analysis

## üè• System Model

The simulation models a two-stage ER process:

```
Patient Arrival ‚Üí Triage Queue ‚Üí Triage Nurse ‚Üí Consultation Queue ‚Üí Doctor ‚Üí Discharge
```

### System Parameters
- **Patient Arrivals**: Exponential distribution (mean: 4 minutes)
- **Triage Service**: Uniform distribution (3-6 minutes)
- **Consultation Service**: Uniform distribution (5-15 minutes)
- **Shift Duration**: 8 hours (480 minutes)
- **Resources**: 2 triage nurses, 3 doctors (configurable)

## üîß Code Architecture

### Core Classes

#### 1. Event System
```python
class EventType(Enum):
    PATIENT_ARRIVAL = "patient_arrival"
    TRIAGE_COMPLETE = "triage_complete"
    CONSULTATION_COMPLETE = "consultation_complete"

@dataclass
class Event:
    time: float
    event_type: EventType
    patient_id: int
    
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.time < other.time
```

**Purpose**: Manages simulation events using a priority queue for chronological processing.

**Simple Explanation**: 
- **EventType**: This is like a list of different things that can happen in the hospital. We have three main events:
  - `PATIENT_ARRIVAL`: When a new patient shows up at the ER
  - `TRIAGE_COMPLETE`: When a nurse finishes checking a patient
  - `CONSULTATION_COMPLETE`: When a doctor finishes seeing a patient

- **Event**: This is like a note that says "something happened at a specific time". Each event has:
  - `time`: When this event happened (like 10:30 AM)
  - `event_type`: What kind of event it was (patient arrived, triage finished, etc.)
  - `patient_id`: Which patient this event is about (like patient #5)

- **`__lt__` method**: This tells the computer how to sort events by time. It's like putting events in order from earliest to latest.

#### 2. Patient Tracking
```python
@dataclass
class Patient:
    id: int
    arrival_time: float
    triage_start_time: Optional[float] = None
    triage_end_time: Optional[float] = None
    consultation_start_time: Optional[float] = None
    consultation_end_time: Optional[float] = None
    
    @property
    def triage_wait_time(self) -> float:
        if self.triage_start_time is None:
            return 0
        return self.triage_start_time - self.arrival_time
    
    @property
    def total_wait_time(self) -> float:
        return self.triage_wait_time + self.consultation_wait_time
```

**Purpose**: Tracks individual patient journey and calculates wait/service times.

**Simple Explanation**:
- **Patient**: This is like a patient's medical record that follows them through the ER. It keeps track of:
  - `id`: Patient's number (like patient #1, #2, etc.)
  - `arrival_time`: When they first walked into the ER
  - `triage_start_time`: When a nurse started checking them
  - `triage_end_time`: When the nurse finished checking them
  - `consultation_start_time`: When a doctor started seeing them
  - `consultation_end_time`: When the doctor finished seeing them

- **`triage_wait_time`**: This calculates how long the patient had to wait before a nurse could see them. It's like: "When did the nurse start seeing them?" minus "When did they arrive?"

- **`total_wait_time`**: This adds up all the waiting time - both waiting for the nurse and waiting for the doctor.

Think of it like a stopwatch that starts when the patient arrives and keeps track of every step of their journey through the ER.

#### 3. Main Simulation Engine
```python
class ERSimulation:
    def __init__(self, 
                 num_triage_nurses: int = 2,
                 num_doctors: int = 3,
                 shift_duration: float = 480.0,
                 arrival_mean: float = 4.0,
                 triage_min: float = 3.0,
                 triage_max: float = 6.0,
                 consultation_min: float = 5.0,
                 consultation_max: float = 15.0):
        
        # System parameters
        self.num_triage_nurses = num_triage_nurses
        self.num_doctors = num_doctors
        self.shift_duration = shift_duration
        
        # Simulation state
        self.current_time = 0.0
        self.events = []  # Priority queue
        self.patients = {}  # Dictionary of all patients
        
        # Resource states
        self.available_triage_nurses = num_triage_nurses
        self.available_doctors = num_doctors
        
        # Queues
        self.triage_queue = []
        self.consultation_queue = []
        
        # Statistics tracking
        self.stats = {
            'total_patients': 0,
            'completed_patients': 0,
            'triage_wait_times': [],
            'consultation_wait_times': [],
            'total_wait_times': [],
            'triage_service_times': [],
            'consultation_service_times': [],
            'triage_queue_lengths': [],
            'consultation_queue_lengths': [],
            'triage_utilization': [],
            'doctor_utilization': [],
            'time_points': []
        }
```

**Simple Explanation**:
This is like setting up a virtual hospital ER. Think of it as creating a digital version of the emergency room with:

**System Setup** (like hospital planning):
- `num_triage_nurses`: How many nurses are working (default: 2)
- `num_doctors`: How many doctors are working (default: 3)
- `shift_duration`: How long the shift lasts in minutes (default: 480 = 8 hours)
- `arrival_mean`: How often patients arrive (default: every 4 minutes on average)
- `triage_min/max`: How long triage takes (3-6 minutes)
- `consultation_min/max`: How long doctor consultation takes (5-15 minutes)

**Hospital State** (like the current situation):
- `current_time`: What time it is in the simulation (starts at 0)
- `events`: A list of things that will happen (like a schedule)
- `patients`: A list of all patients in the system

**Available Staff** (like who's free to work):
- `available_triage_nurses`: How many nurses are not busy right now
- `available_doctors`: How many doctors are not busy right now

**Waiting Lines** (like the waiting room):
- `triage_queue`: Patients waiting to see a nurse
- `consultation_queue`: Patients waiting to see a doctor

**Statistics** (like keeping track of everything):
- `total_patients`: How many patients have come in total
- `completed_patients`: How many patients have finished their treatment
- `triage_wait_times`: How long each patient waited for a nurse
- `consultation_wait_times`: How long each patient waited for a doctor
- And many more tracking items...

### Key Methods

#### Event Scheduling
```python
def _schedule_next_arrival(self):
    """Schedule the next patient arrival using exponential distribution"""
    if self.current_time < self.shift_duration:
        inter_arrival_time = random.expovariate(1.0 / self.arrival_mean)
        arrival_time = self.current_time + inter_arrival_time
        
        if arrival_time <= self.shift_duration:
            event = Event(arrival_time, EventType.PATIENT_ARRIVAL, self.patient_id_counter)
            heapq.heappush(self.events, event)
```

**Simple Explanation**:
This function is like a receptionist who decides when the next patient will arrive. Here's what it does:

1. **Check if shift is still going**: `if self.current_time < self.shift_duration`
   - Only schedule new patients if the hospital is still open

2. **Calculate arrival time**: `inter_arrival_time = random.expovariate(1.0 / self.arrival_mean)`
   - This uses a special math formula (exponential distribution) to randomly decide when the next patient will arrive
   - If `arrival_mean = 4`, patients arrive on average every 4 minutes, but sometimes it might be 2 minutes, sometimes 6 minutes

3. **Create the arrival event**: `event = Event(arrival_time, EventType.PATIENT_ARRIVAL, self.patient_id_counter)`
   - This creates a note saying "Patient #X will arrive at time Y"

4. **Add to schedule**: `heapq.heappush(self.events, event)`
   - This puts the event in a special list that keeps everything in time order

**Real-world example**: If it's 10:00 AM and patients arrive every 4 minutes on average, this might schedule the next patient to arrive at 10:03 AM, then the next at 10:07 AM, etc.

#### Service Time Generation
```python
def _generate_triage_time(self) -> float:
    """Generate triage service time using uniform distribution"""
    return random.uniform(self.triage_min, self.triage_max)

def _generate_consultation_time(self) -> float:
    """Generate consultation service time using uniform distribution"""
    return random.uniform(self.consultation_min, self.consultation_max)
```

**Simple Explanation**:
These functions are like timers that decide how long each medical procedure will take. In real life, some patients take longer to treat than others.

**`_generate_triage_time()`**:
- This decides how long a nurse will spend checking a patient
- Uses `random.uniform(self.triage_min, self.triage_max)` which means:
  - If `triage_min = 3` and `triage_max = 6`
  - The nurse might spend 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, or 6 minutes
  - Each time is equally likely (uniform distribution)

**`_generate_consultation_time()`**:
- This decides how long a doctor will spend with a patient
- Uses `random.uniform(self.consultation_min, self.consultation_max)` which means:
  - If `consultation_min = 5` and `consultation_max = 15`
  - The doctor might spend 5 minutes, 8 minutes, 12 minutes, or 15 minutes
  - Each time is equally likely

**Real-world example**: 
- A simple case might take 3 minutes for triage and 5 minutes for consultation
- A complex case might take 6 minutes for triage and 15 minutes for consultation
- The simulation randomly picks times within these ranges to make it realistic

#### Patient Flow Management
```python
def _handle_patient_arrival(self, patient_id: int):
    """Handle a new patient arrival"""
    patient = Patient(id=patient_id, arrival_time=self.current_time)
    self.patients[patient_id] = patient
    self.stats['total_patients'] += 1
    
    # Try to start triage immediately
    if self.available_triage_nurses > 0:
        self._start_triage(patient)
    else:
        # Add to triage queue
        self.triage_queue.append(patient)
    
    # Schedule next arrival
    self._schedule_next_arrival()
```

**Simple Explanation**:
This function is like a receptionist who greets each new patient and decides what happens next. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Create patient record**: `patient = Patient(id=patient_id, arrival_time=self.current_time)`
   - This creates a new patient file with their ID and arrival time
   - Like filling out a new patient form

2. **Add to patient list**: `self.patients[patient_id] = patient`
   - This puts the patient in the hospital's master list
   - Like adding them to the hospital database

3. **Update statistics**: `self.stats['total_patients'] += 1`
   - This increases the count of total patients who have arrived
   - Like updating the daily patient count

4. **Check if nurse is available**: `if self.available_triage_nurses > 0:`
   - This checks if there's a free nurse to see the patient immediately
   - Like looking around to see if any nurses are free

5. **If nurse is free**: `self._start_triage(patient)`
   - Start the triage process right away
   - Like immediately calling a nurse to see the patient

6. **If no nurse is free**: `self.triage_queue.append(patient)`
   - Put the patient in the waiting line
   - Like telling the patient "Please take a seat, a nurse will be with you shortly"

7. **Schedule next patient**: `self._schedule_next_arrival()`
   - Plan when the next patient will arrive
   - Like the receptionist looking at their schedule

**Real-world example**: 
- Patient #5 arrives at 10:30 AM
- Receptionist checks: "Is there a free nurse?" 
- If yes: "Nurse Sarah, please see patient #5"
- If no: "Patient #5, please wait in the triage waiting area"

#### Resource Allocation
```python
def _start_triage(self, patient: Patient):
    """Start triage for a patient"""
    self.available_triage_nurses -= 1
    patient.triage_start_time = self.current_time
    
    # Schedule triage completion
    triage_time = self._generate_triage_time()
    triage_end_time = self.current_time + triage_time
    
    event = Event(triage_end_time, EventType.TRIAGE_COMPLETE, patient.id)
    heapq.heappush(self.events, event)
```

**Simple Explanation**:
This function is like a nurse manager who assigns a nurse to a patient and schedules when they'll finish. Here's what happens:

1. **Assign a nurse**: `self.available_triage_nurses -= 1`
   - This marks one nurse as "busy" (reduces the count of available nurses)
   - Like saying "Nurse Sarah is now busy with a patient"

2. **Record start time**: `patient.triage_start_time = self.current_time`
   - This writes down exactly when the nurse started seeing the patient
   - Like clocking in when the nurse starts the triage

3. **Calculate how long it will take**: `triage_time = self._generate_triage_time()`
   - This randomly decides how long this specific triage will take (3-6 minutes)
   - Like estimating "This patient will take about 4 minutes to check"

4. **Calculate finish time**: `triage_end_time = self.current_time + triage_time`
   - This calculates when the nurse will finish
   - Like saying "If it's 10:30 AM now and it takes 4 minutes, they'll finish at 10:34 AM"

5. **Schedule the completion**: `event = Event(triage_end_time, EventType.TRIAGE_COMPLETE, patient.id)`
   - This creates a reminder that says "At 10:34 AM, nurse will finish with patient #5"
   - Like putting an appointment in the calendar

6. **Add to schedule**: `heapq.heappush(self.events, event)`
   - This puts the completion event in the hospital's master schedule
   - Like adding it to the daily planner

**Real-world example**:
- It's 10:30 AM
- Nurse Sarah starts seeing patient #5
- The system randomly decides this triage will take 4 minutes
- It schedules a reminder for 10:34 AM: "Nurse Sarah will finish with patient #5"

#### Main Simulation Loop
```python
def run(self):
    """Run the simulation"""
    print(f"Starting ER simulation...")
    print(f"Parameters: {self.num_triage_nurses} nurses, {self.num_doctors} doctors")
    print(f"Shift duration: {self.shift_duration} minutes")
    
    while self.events and self.current_time < self.shift_duration:
        # Get next event
        event = heapq.heappop(self.events)
        self.current_time = event.time
        
        # Update statistics
        self._update_statistics()
        
        # Handle event
        if event.event_type == EventType.PATIENT_ARRIVAL:
            self._handle_patient_arrival(event.patient_id)
        elif event.event_type == EventType.TRIAGE_COMPLETE:
            self._handle_triage_complete(event.patient_id)
        elif event.event_type == EventType.CONSULTATION_COMPLETE:
            self._handle_consultation_complete(event.patient_id)
    
    print(f"Simulation completed at time {self.current_time:.2f} minutes")
    return self.get_results()
```

**Simple Explanation**:
This is the main "brain" of the simulation - like a hospital manager who runs the entire ER shift. It's like a clock that ticks forward and handles everything that happens. Here's how it works:

1. **Start the shift**: 
   - Print the setup information (how many nurses, doctors, shift length)
   - Like a manager starting their shift and reviewing the day's plan

2. **Main loop**: `while self.events and self.current_time < self.shift_duration:`
   - Keep going as long as there are events to handle AND the shift isn't over
   - Like saying "Keep working until there's nothing left to do or the shift ends"

3. **Get the next event**: `event = heapq.heappop(self.events)`
   - Take the next scheduled event from the list (the earliest one)
   - Like looking at your calendar and seeing "What's the next thing I need to do?"

4. **Update the clock**: `self.current_time = event.time`
   - Move the simulation time forward to when this event happens
   - Like saying "It's now 10:34 AM" (when the event is scheduled)

5. **Update statistics**: `self._update_statistics()`
   - Record what's happening right now (queue lengths, staff busy/free)
   - Like taking a snapshot of the current situation

6. **Handle the event**: The big decision tree
   - **If it's a patient arrival**: `self._handle_patient_arrival(event.patient_id)`
     - Like a receptionist greeting a new patient
   - **If it's triage completion**: `self._handle_triage_complete(event.patient_id)`
     - Like a nurse finishing with a patient and sending them to the doctor
   - **If it's consultation completion**: `self._handle_consultation_complete(event.patient_id)`
     - Like a doctor finishing with a patient and discharging them

7. **End the shift**: When the loop ends, print completion message and return results

**Real-world example**:
- It's 10:30 AM: "Next event: Patient #5 arrives"
- Handle patient arrival
- It's 10:34 AM: "Next event: Nurse finishes with patient #5"
- Handle triage completion
- It's 10:40 AM: "Next event: Patient #6 arrives"
- And so on until the shift ends...

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Wait Times
- **Triage Wait**: Time from arrival to triage start
- **Consultation Wait**: Time from triage completion to consultation start
- **Total Wait**: Sum of triage and consultation wait times

**Simple Explanation**:
Think of these like waiting in line at different places:

**Triage Wait**: How long you wait before a nurse sees you
- Like waiting in line at the reception desk
- "I arrived at 10:00 AM, but the nurse didn't start seeing me until 10:05 AM"
- Wait time = 5 minutes

**Consultation Wait**: How long you wait before a doctor sees you
- Like waiting in the doctor's waiting room after the nurse is done
- "The nurse finished at 10:08 AM, but the doctor didn't start seeing me until 10:15 AM"
- Wait time = 7 minutes

**Total Wait**: All the waiting time combined
- "I waited 5 minutes for the nurse + 7 minutes for the doctor = 12 minutes total"

### Service Times
- **Triage Service**: Time from triage start to completion
- **Consultation Service**: Time from consultation start to completion
- **Total Service**: Sum of triage and consultation service times

**Simple Explanation**:
These are the actual treatment times - how long the medical staff spend with each patient:

**Triage Service**: How long the nurse spends checking the patient
- Like the actual time the nurse is examining you
- "The nurse started checking me at 10:05 AM and finished at 10:08 AM"
- Service time = 3 minutes

**Consultation Service**: How long the doctor spends with the patient
- Like the actual time the doctor is treating you
- "The doctor started seeing me at 10:15 AM and finished at 10:25 AM"
- Service time = 10 minutes

**Total Service**: All the treatment time combined
- "Nurse spent 3 minutes + doctor spent 10 minutes = 13 minutes total treatment time"

### Queue Analysis
- **Triage Queue Length**: Number of patients waiting for triage
- **Consultation Queue Length**: Number of patients waiting for consultation
- **Maximum Queue Lengths**: Peak queue sizes during simulation

**Simple Explanation**:
These tell you how crowded the waiting areas are:

**Triage Queue Length**: How many people are waiting to see a nurse
- Like counting people in the reception area
- "There are 3 people waiting to see a nurse right now"

**Consultation Queue Length**: How many people are waiting to see a doctor
- Like counting people in the doctor's waiting room
- "There are 5 people waiting to see a doctor right now"

**Maximum Queue Lengths**: The busiest the waiting areas ever got
- Like remembering "The reception area was most crowded with 8 people waiting"
- This helps understand peak demand periods

### Resource Utilization
- **Triage Nurse Utilization**: Percentage of time nurses are busy
- **Doctor Utilization**: Percentage of time doctors are busy

**Simple Explanation**:
These tell you how busy the medical staff are:

**Triage Nurse Utilization**: How much of their time nurses spend working vs. waiting
- Like saying "Nurses are busy 80% of the time, free 20% of the time"
- 80% utilization means nurses are working most of the time
- 20% utilization means nurses are often free and waiting for patients

**Doctor Utilization**: How much of their time doctors spend working vs. waiting
- Like saying "Doctors are busy 90% of the time, free 10% of the time"
- High utilization (90%) means doctors are very busy
- Low utilization (30%) means doctors often have free time

**What this means**:
- **High utilization** (80-90%): Staff are working hard, but patients might wait longer
- **Low utilization** (20-30%): Staff have free time, but might be overstaffed
- **Balanced utilization** (50-70%): Good balance between efficiency and patient care

### Throughput
- **Patients per Hour**: Average patients completed per hour
- **Total Patients Served**: Number of patients who completed the entire process

**Simple Explanation**:
These tell you how many patients the ER can handle:

**Patients per Hour**: How many patients complete their entire treatment per hour
- Like saying "The ER can treat 15 patients per hour on average"
- This measures the ER's capacity and efficiency
- Higher numbers mean the ER is more efficient

**Total Patients Served**: How many patients completed their full treatment during the shift
- Like saying "During the 8-hour shift, we treated 120 patients"
- This shows the total workload handled

**What this means**:
- **High throughput** (15+ patients/hour): ER is efficient and can handle many patients
- **Low throughput** (5-8 patients/hour): ER might be understaffed or inefficient
- **Balanced throughput** (10-15 patients/hour): Good balance of quality care and efficiency

**How to Read These Results:**

**Patient Flow:**
- **121 patients arrived** during the 8-hour shift
- **119 patients completed** their full treatment (2 left without finishing)
- **14.88 patients per hour** - the ER treated about 15 patients every hour

**Wait Times (Patient Experience):**
- **1.41 minutes** average wait for a nurse - patients usually get seen quickly by nurses
- **7.80 minutes** average wait for a doctor - patients wait longer for doctors
- **9.19 minutes** total wait time - from arrival to starting treatment

**Service Times (Treatment Duration):**
- **4.59 minutes** average nurse triage time - nurses spend about 4-5 minutes checking patients
- **10.12 minutes** average doctor consultation time - doctors spend about 10 minutes with patients
- **14.72 minutes** total treatment time - from start to finish of medical care

**Queue Analysis (Crowding):**
- **Maximum 5 patients** waiting for nurses at any time
- **Maximum 10 patients** waiting for doctors at any time
- The doctor waiting area gets more crowded than the nurse area

**Staff Utilization (Efficiency):**
- **67.08% nurse utilization** - nurses are busy about 2/3 of the time
- **87.22% doctor utilization** - doctors are busy almost 90% of the time
- Doctors are working harder than nurses in this setup

**What This Means:**
- The ER is running efficiently (treating 15 patients/hour)
- Patients don't wait too long (under 10 minutes total wait)
- Doctors are very busy (87% utilization) - might need more doctors
- Nurses have some free time (67% utilization) - might have enough nurses

### Running Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
python scenario_analysis.py
```

This will generate:
- Detailed comparison tables
- Visualization charts
- CSV export of results
- Data-driven recommendations
