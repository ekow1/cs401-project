### Exponential Model
```
fuel = a × exp(b×distance) × exp(c×load) × exp(d×traffic) × exp(e×weather)
```
Where a, b, c, d, e are fitted parameters.

### Custom Power Function Model
```
fuel = a × distance^b + c × load^d + e × traffic^f + g × distance × load × traffic × weather
```
Where a, b, c, d, e, f, g are fitted parameters.
